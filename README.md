## About
* In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.


## Installation
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/csbistline/mongo-scraper.git
* Run `npm install`
* Live demo: https://mongo-scraper-csb.herokuapp.com//

## How-to use this application
* Load the home page and click on "Scrape for New Stories". This will search MLB.com and deliver all the latest headlines, adding any new ones to a database. To delete all the scraped articles, click "Delete Scraped Stories". Use the buttons to either read the story or save it to read later. The "Saved Stories" link will display all stories that have been saved to your collection. Delete all saved stories by clicking the button in the menu bar, or delete an individual storie by clicking its delete button. From this view, you may also add notes to a saved story.
